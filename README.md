# Auto-Complete-System-Using-Trie-Data-Set
During my "Data Structures" course, I completed a project on implementing an Auto-Complete System using the Trie data structure in C++. This hands-on experience allowed me to delve into the practical application of Trie, a fundamental data structure known for its efficiency in prefix searching.

The project significantly enhanced my understanding of data structure implementation, algorithm design, and C++ programming principles. By building the Auto-Complete System, I solidified my knowledge of Trie operations like insertion, searching, and retrieval, while also gaining valuable insights into string manipulation and memory management techniques in C++. 

Overall, this project not only provided me with a deeper understanding of Trie but also strengthened my foundational skills in data structures, algorithms, and C++ programming. These newfound skills will undoubtedly prove valuable in my future endeavors within the field of computer science.
